# Requider-if

The HTML form elements properties improve.
Idead: make conditional dynamic required elements instead of static required elements only.

For example: there are 2-rirectional radio switcher (Delivery type: 1) pickup; 2) EMS post) and 4 fields for 2th radio.

I want in this sitation have the 4 fields are required if «delivery type» is a «EMS post».
